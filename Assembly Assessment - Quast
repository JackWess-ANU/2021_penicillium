# This is a very short script that can be customised to call Quast for genome statistics. 

# Quast or Quality Assessment tool, is a software package developed by X and available on Github. It is used to provide general details on genomic assemblies in a fasta format. 
# Quast is installed through the conda repository using conda install -c bioconda quast

# To run quast:
# requires an input in fasta or txt format (assembly.fasta)
# -o denotes the designated output folder for quast analysis 

quast assembly.fasta -o quast_output_myassembly

# Quast output can be seen in the summary file report.txt within the designated output folder
# Quast will provide data on:
# The number and size of contigs in the assembly, including the largest contig. 
# Total size of genome assembly. 
# GC %
# N50, N75, L50 and L75. 
# Number of N (errors) per 100kbp.
