# This is a short script used to call the BUSCO program, to assess genome completeness. 

# BUSCO is a software package designed to Benchmark (or identify) Universal Single Copy Ortholog genes in an assembly, with respect to the BUSCOs shared in the designated 
# hierarchical group (e.g. genus, order). 

# BUSCO is open-access software developed by Rob Waterhouse and associates and is available from github. 

# -i denotes input, namely a genome assembly in a fasta or txt format. 
# -l denotes lineage, meaning the hierachical section that one wishes to compare their assembly to, for PenicilliumX I chose the section eurotialesodb10 (odb10 denoting its nature 
# as a database).
# -o denotes output, meaning the name of the output folder as desired by the user. 
# -m denotes mode, using genome sets the mode to genome as the input is a full genome assembly. 
# -c denotes the thread count or computational power alloted to the process. 

# Here is an example of the busco code I ran to find the BUSCO score for my assembly:

busco -i 10kb8QCanu -l eurotialesdb10 -o 10kb8QCanu_busco_output -m genome -c 6

# Busco output is delivered in the output folder, but can also be seen in the standard output, delivering:
# No. of complete BUSCOs (and further broken down into complete and single-copy BUSCOs and complete and duplicated BUSCOs). 
# No. of fragmented BUSCOs.
# No. of missing BUSCOs.
# No. of total BUSCO groups searched.
# A percentage score of complete BUSCOs.
