# This is a very short script showing how to use the python script FindTelomeres on a genome assembly.
# FindTelomeres is a python script created by Jana Sperschneider and available to download from Github. 
# FindTelomeres works by identifying regions of telomeric repeats in the assembly (both forward and reverse).

# Firstly, the FindTelomeres script must be downloaded from Github using:
wget https://github.com/JanaSperschneider/FindTelomeres/blob/master/FindTelomeres.py


# To then run the script one must use:

python FindTelomeres.py assembly.fasta

# Output will only be shown in the standard output and must therefore be screenshotted or recorded in an electronic notebook. 
# Output will include forward and reverse identified telomeric repeat regions for each contig in which they are present. 
# If a chromosome-level assembly is present one would expect each contig to have both a forward and reverse telomere found.
